# Epic Pizza

Because something like "Epicodus Week 4 Project -- Pizza Ordering" is just way too much to type. Oh wait.

## Installation

Nope, it's just an HTML project. If you want you can clone it to a folder and open the index.html file, and probably no one will even try to stop you.

## Usage

Press the shiny buttons to make a pizza. Unfortunately it will not be a very tasty pizza because you can't really do that with javascript.

## Specifications

I'mma just say, this part is pretty silly.

The application will accept user input from HTML form controls.
The application will accept a size input and one or more options for toppings, selected from a list.
The application will pass these inputs to the back-end logic functions, which will return a Pizza object with those qualities
The application will display the resulting pizza to the user and generate a cost using the Pizza object's `cost()` method, which will also be displayed
